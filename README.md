# GeoBlocker

GeoBlocker is an SSH geo-limiting helper for Ubuntu 24.04 that:

- Downloads US-only IP ranges (IPv4 + IPv6) from IPdeny  
- Loads them into nftables sets (`us_v4`, `us_v6`)  
- Provides investigation utilities  
- Helps users safely configure US-only SSH access  

Version: see script header.
